# user_metrics

This repo was created as a source for anyonne looking to construct metrics or scores for on-chain users. We have a set of seven metric categories, each with standardize metrics that are applied across chains (to the extent that it's possible to calculate a metric on a given chain). 

SQL Folder Structure:

> category
>> chain
>>> metric_name.sql
>> chain
>>> metric_name.sql
